# Take-Home Assignment

The goal of this take-home assignment is to evaluate your abilities to use API, data calculation and transformation, SQL, and visualization in Python.

## Problem Statement:

Design a program that performs the following tasks:

1. Use an API to retrieve financial data for a specific stock (including the closing price and volume of a stock traded on the NYSE, given a two weeks' time period). My recommend one is Alpha Vintage, but it is not mandatory. Reference: https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/
2. Store the data in a database (e.g., SQLite, MySQL, ...), you should design the table and create a ddl file for your schema definition
3. Perform some basic calculations on the data (e.g., calculate the average closing price and volume for a specified time period)
4. Create a graphical representation of the data (e.g., a line chart or bar chart)
5. Write the results to a new file (e.g., a CSV file or a PDF report)

## Requirements:

- The program should be written in Python 3.
- You are free to use any API and libraries you like, but should include a brief explanation of why you chose the API and libraries you used.
- The database could be created using SQLite/MySQL/.. and should include at least two tables: one to store the raw data from the API and one to store the results of the calculations.
- The program should include error handling to handle cases where the API returns an error or the data is not in the correct format.
- The program should use appropriate data structures and algorithms to store the data and perform the calculations.
- The program should be modular, with functions for retrieving data from the API, storing data in the database, performing the calculations, creating the graphical representation, and writing the results to a file.
- The program should include appropriate documentation, including docstrings and inline comments to explain the code.

## Submission:

Please submit the following:

- The Python source code of your solution.
- A brief explanation of your design choices and trade-offs, as well as any challenges you faced while implementing the program.
- A sample input file and the corresponding output file generated by your program.

optional:

- a Dockerfile which can build up your local db environment is a plus

## Evaluation Criteria:

Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Correctness: Does the program produce the correct results?
- Code quality: Is the code well-structured, easy to read, and maintainable?
- Design: Does the program make good use of functions, data structures, algorithms, databases, and libraries?
- Error handling: Does the program handle errors and unexpected input appropriately?
- Documentation: Is the code adequately documented, with clear explanations of the algorithms and data structures used?

## Additional Notes:

You have 3 days to complete this assignment and submit your solution.
